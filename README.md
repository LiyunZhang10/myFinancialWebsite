# myFinancialWebsite

Hello everyone! I am a sophomore student from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and I am excited to present my coursework project. 📊🎉

In this project, I have developed a simple financial webpage that provides users with basic financial data and visualizations. 💼💻

The financial webpage offers users access to real-time stock prices and currency exchange rates. Users can navigate through the webpage to view the latest financial data and track market trends. 🌎💹

Using Python, I have created interactive line charts and pie charts to visualize the stock prices and currency exchange rates. These visual representations make it easy for users to understand the data and identify trends. 📈📊

I appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have to improve this project. Thank you for your support! 🙏😊
